# Description

in vn usually usually you can use keyboard to do basic navigation.
need to implment keyboard events and handle them with actions
we should add a spec to do a demo for something like this:

- press space to hide/show dialogue box
- press enter to call nextLine

we should create a new resource type or something to configure keyboard settings. for example in the menu page, I would use a certain settings of keybords, in the reading  page I use a different one, so it should be possible to switch from one to another.
