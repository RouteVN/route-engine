# Description
Here are some bugs encountered when implementing feature for visuals.
These bugs may not be limited to visuals. Some may require changes in route-graphics. 

Including but not limited to:

- If adding a particle with different ID after an existing particle, there will be null exception 
  - suspect accessing particles that are being recycled
  - may need modification in route-graphics

- In visual-animation-1.yaml, 
```yaml
- id: line2
    actions:
    visual:
        items:
        - id: visual-1
            resourceId: 8a3lkja
            transformId: centerPos
- id: line3
    actions:
    visual:
        items:
        - id: visual-1
            resourceId: 8a3lkja
            transformId: centerPos
            animations:
            out:
                resourceId: 8h3js
```
- items are not updated even with new animations.
  - Has something to do with how route-engine decide to update or keep elements 

# Plan
- First find out what causes these bugs, whether it is wrong usage or source code bug.
